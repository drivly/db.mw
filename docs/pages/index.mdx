# DB.MW

The [Multiworld Database](https://db.mw) at https://db.mw is a globally-distributed ACID-compliant multi-model
native implementation of GraphDL with the intuitive and natural expressiveness of the Graph Database World, 
the flexibility of the Document Database World, and the constraints with foreign keys and referential integrity 
of the Relational Database World.

It is a multi-cloud mult-tenant meta-database built on top of [Mongo Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas),
AWS, Azure, and GCP.
