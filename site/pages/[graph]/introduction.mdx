# DB.MW

The [Multiworld Database](https://db.mw) at https://db.mw is a globally-distributed ACID-compliant multi-model
native implementation of GraphDL with the intuitive and natural expressiveness of the Graph Database World, 
the flexibility of the Document Database World, and the constraints with foreign keys and referential integrity 
of the Relational Database World.

It is a multi-cloud mult-tenant meta-database built on top of Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects running in over
280 cities around the world.  Full-text search is provided by Lucene.  The database is fully ACID-compliant
with transactional support for all operations.  The database is globally distributed and sharded, and is
fully horizontally scalable.  The database is natively multi-tenant, and is infinitely scalable.

The database is a native implementation of GraphDL, a declarative language for describing Nouns and relationships
between them as Verbs.
